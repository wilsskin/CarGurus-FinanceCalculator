This prototype was created as part of our senior capstone project in collaboration with the CarGurus team. It explores a more transparent and user-friendly way for customers to understand the true cost of buying a car—especially when financing is involved.

The tool aims to supplement the existing buyer experience by giving users a clearer breakdown of monthly payments, interest, and additional fees typically found in the dealer's buyer order. It’s designed to be a starting point for internal discussions, user testing, and potential product development.

We’re incredibly grateful to the CarGurus team—especially Ryan—for the opportunity to work together and for supporting us throughout this process.
